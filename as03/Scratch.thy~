theorem 
  assumes a: "(\<forall> x. P x) \<and> (\<forall> x. Q x)"
  shows "\<forall> x. P x \<and> Q x"
proof -
  {
    fix x
    from a have "\<forall> x. P x" by (rule conjunct1)
    then  have px: "P x" by (rule allE)
    from a have "\<forall> x. Q x" by (rule conjunct2)
    then have "Q x" by (rule allE)
    with px have "P x \<and> Q x" by (rule conjI)    
  }
  thus ?thesis by (rule allI)

lemma
  assumes "\<exists> x. P x \<and> Q x"
  shows "\<exists> x. P x"
proof -
  from assms obtain x where 1: "P x \<and> Q x" by (rule exE)
  then have xx: "P x" by (rule conjunct1)
  then show ?thesis by (rule exI)

lemma
  assumes "\<forall> x. P x"
  shows "\<exists>x. P x"
proof -

lemma
  shows "((\<forall> x. P x) \<and> (\<forall> x. Q x)) \<longleftrightarrow> (\<forall> x. P x \<and> Q x)"
proof -

    {
      fix x
      from a have "\<forall> x. P x" by (rule conjunct1)
      then have b: "P x" by (rule allE)

      then have c: "Q x" by (rule allE)
      from b c have "P x \<and> Q x" by (rule conjI)
    }
    then have "(\<forall> x. P x \<and> Q x)" by (rule allI)

  from lhs rhs show ?thesis by (rule iffI)
